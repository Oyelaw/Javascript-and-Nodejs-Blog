{"id":"lfhmbonu12zhxjroml1i","title":"Creating a Post from admin end","article":"Welcome, we are going to discuss creating posts from the admin section. \nFirst thing you see when you log in is the post creation form, required fields are post title and post body. Select post Images is optional.\nThe post title will automatically get converted to upper case on the home page.\nThe image selection was a tricky business, Right now you have a template/placeholder that shows you the format it expects that payload in. You can provide a url to an online image, in future examples i will be using images I have stored in my cloudinary account. \nIt is important to remember that the src(source) attribute should be provided just like the placeholder i.e the link to the image should be in between quotes (\" \"). Putting the src without the quotes will most likely result in an error. Also, the placeholders kinda like act like real values, so I suggest if you want a post with out images, DELETE the SELECT POST IMAGES placeholder before you hit submit. \n\nP.S \nI am already working on a dynamic solution where users can simply select pictures using an input filed (<Input type=\"file\" multiple />) and send the images direct to cloudinary for storage.
